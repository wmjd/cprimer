Don't make this mistake again and be careful that these:

for( ... ; dst[i++] = src[k++]; ){ ... }
for( ... ; dst[i] = src[k]; i++, k++){ ... }

Are not the same. When the test condition fails, the counters are incremented in the first case.
The counters in the second case are one behind the counters in the first case after the loops finish.

This was causing (in concat'ing & formatting a string in 4.c) the null byte to be written (and not *overwritten* -- actually both cases write a null byte but since the second case does not increment the counters, the next processing (not shown here) will overwrite the nullbyte.
