Want to see what happens:
	open a file for appending
	setvbuf to _IOFBF for fully buffered mode
	fputs a string smaller than buf size
	(I think terminating program & closing the file will flush the buffer and I DON'T want that)
	infinite loop or block on getchar() to prevent termination
	. . .
	While the program is looping/blocked, use shell to check on this file.
	Will the string be appended?
	Ctrl-C. Does this cause write?
	If not, try blocking on getchar(). Does this cause write?
